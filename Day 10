Day 10

Successfully installed Docker Desktop and ran my first container using Nginx! 🐳

✅ Step 1: Install Docker Desktop
Go to the official Docker website:
🔗 https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/

Click “Download for Windows”.

After downloading, run the installer.

During installation:

Select WSL 2 as the backend (recommended)



✅ Step 2: Verify Docker Installation
After your system restarts:

Open Command Prompt or PowerShell

Run:
docker --version

You should see something like:
Docker version 24.xx, build xxxx

✅ Step 3: Run Your First Container – Nginx
Now that Docker is running:

Pull and run the Nginx container:
docker run -d -p 8080:80 nginx

-d → runs in detached (background) mode
-p 8080:80 → maps port 80 of the container to your localhost:8080

Open your browser and visit:
🌐 http://localhost:8080

You’ll see the Nginx welcome page.

✅ Step 4: Check Running Containers

docker ps

It shows a list of running containers.
If you face any issues like:
❌ dockerDesktopLinuxEngine/_ping not found
🔁 Restart Docker Desktop from the Start Menu

Ensure WSL 2 and virtualization are enabled in your system

Day 8

Learn YAML + GitHub Actions Pipeline

✅ Step 1: Understand What YAML Is
YAML (YAML Ain’t Markup Language) is used to write configuration files in a human-readable format.

YAML Syntax Example:
name: My First Workflow
on: [push]
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Run echo
        run: echo "Hello DevOps!"

🟡 YAML uses spaces (not tabs). Indentation matters a lot.


✅ Step 2: Create a Sample GitHub Repo

Go to https://github.com → create new repo → Name: github-actions-demo.

Clone it to your local machine:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/github-actions-demo.git
cd github-actions-demo


✅ Step 3: Create Your First GitHub Actions Workflow File
Create these folders and file:
mkdir -p .github/workflows
touch .github/workflows/hello.yml

Edit hello.yml (open with VS Code or Notepad):
name: Hello World CI
on: [push]
jobs:
  say-hello:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Print Hello
        run: echo "🎉 Hello from GitHub Actions!"


✅ Step 4: Commit and Push the Workflow
git add .
git commit -m "Add GitHub Actions workflow"
git push origin main

⏳ Now go to your repo → Actions tab → you'll see the workflow running.


✅ Step 5: View Output
Go to Actions → Click on the latest workflow → say-hello job → Print Hello step.

You’ll see the output: 🎉 Hello from GitHub Actions!
